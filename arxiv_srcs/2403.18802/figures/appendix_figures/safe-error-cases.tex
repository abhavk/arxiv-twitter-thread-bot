        Causes of \safe{} returning an incorrect rating on the 100 disagreement examples with ``researcher + full internet access'' ground-truth labels from \cref{sec:safe-outperforms-human-annotators}.
        ``Reasoning error'': error in the language model's reasoning in either rating a claim as relevant/irrelevant to the prompt or rating a claim as supported/not supported by a set of search results.
        ``Google Search'': the necessary information to rate the fact was not found in the results from the model's Google Search queries.
        ``Revision error'': the model did not correctly revise a response to be self-contained.
