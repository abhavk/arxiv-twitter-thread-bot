Comparison of losses with different FIM implementations. While document level FIM introduces partially broken data into training, it does not hurt the autoregressive loss (left). We also find that the reduction in FIM perplexity (right) is not commensurate to the gain in pass rate shown in Figure \ref{fig:pretraining:doc-context}.
